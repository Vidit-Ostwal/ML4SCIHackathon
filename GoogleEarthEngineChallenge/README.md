### Description

Learn to create and troubleshoot supervised land-use/land-cover (LULC) classifications using Google Earth Engine (GEE). You will use multispectral optical imagery from the Landsat 8 satellite to train a supervised classification model and compare it to the USGS National Land Cover Database. Classification accuracy will be calculated using the results of a confusion matrix and a validation layer. The example below is for testing purposes only and is meant to inspire creative problem solving for improving the overall accuracy of LULC models. You will need a GEE account to participate!

### Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation will be based primarily on the overall accuracy achieved using the validation sample, but consideration will also be given to the explanation of parameterization.

* Overall accuracy calculated from a confusion matrix  

### Deliverables 

Submit a lastnameFirstname_results.txt document that contains each of the required elements below.

* Link to GEE script (use the 'Get Link' button at the top of your code editor)
* Bands selected for parameterization
* Classification method and parameters selected
* Sample size selected
* Rationale for each of the parameters set or post hoc explanation
* Highest overall training/validation accuracy
* If you used a method other than what was supplied here, please detail your methods, parameters, and results, otherwise put N/A here.
