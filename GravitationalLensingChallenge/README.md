### Description

Gravitational lensing has been a cornerstone in many cosmology experiments, and studies since it was discussed in Einsteinâ€™s calculations back in 1936 and discovered in 1979, and one area of particular interest is the study of dark matter via substructure in strong lensing images. The primary aim of this challenge is to design and implement supervised deep learning models to study strong lensing images.

#### Challenge 1 - Multi-Class Classification

In this challenge, we focus on exploring the potential of supervised classification models in identifying dark matter based on simulated strong lensing images with different substructure.

#### Challenge 2 - Regression

### Datasets

#### 1. Multi-Class Classification

The [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_UZtU4W65ZViTJsLeFfvK-xXCYUhw2A/view?usp=sharing) consists of three classes, strong lensing images with no substructure, spherical substructure, and vortex substructure. The images have been normalized using min-max normalization, but you are free to use any normalization or data augmentation methods to improve your results.

#### 2. Regression

+ Add regression dataset description
```

### Evaluation Metrics

#### 1. Multi-Class Classification

* ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AUC score (Area Under the ROC Curve)  

#### 2. Regression

```diff
+ Add regression evaluation metrics
```

The model performance will be tested on the hidden test dataset based on the above metrics.

### Deliverables

* You are required to submit a Google Colab Jupyter Notebook clearly showing your implementation along with the above-mentioned evaluation metrics for the validation data.
* You must also submit the final trained model, including the model architecture and the trained weights ( For example: HDF5 file, .pb file, .pt file, etc. )

You can use the example notebooks provided in this repository as a template for your work.
