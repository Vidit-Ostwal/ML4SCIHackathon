## Problem description 

Galaxies are embedded in large gas haloes termed the “circumgalactic medium (CGM)”. The history of a galaxy is encapsulated in the history of its gas cycling between the visible body of the galaxy and the CGM. The CGM is a source for a galaxy’s star-forming fuel, and plays a role in regulating the galactic gas supply. Understanding the CGM and its history thus offers insight into galaxy evolution. 

One way to study galaxy CGMs is through the absorption lines they cause in the spectra of bright background objects, such as quasars. As the light passes through a slab of gas constituting the CGM, the gas absorbs part of the light, resulting in an absorption line in the resulting spectrum, as the figure below illustrates. 

(Note that the light intensity is always **non-negative**).

The characteristics of the absorption lines depend on the properties and type of the gas itself. Thus, it is plausible that there are some underlying/latent gas characteristics, such as density, temperature, elemental abundances and velocity that result in spectra with similar characteristics. These properties are unobservable, which motivates the search for an underlying latent space — a low-dimensional representation of spectra, which would capture these properties.

Your task will be to find a latent space from which the original spectra can be reconstructed with minimal information loss
